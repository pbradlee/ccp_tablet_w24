                    <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings. They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it. Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until completely smooth.  Transfer to the refrigerator to rest for at least 2 hours or up to 2 days.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees if you plan to eat the pannkakor right away.  Heat a 10 inch nonstick skillet over medium heat.  Stir the batter briefly to recombine. Brush skillet with melted butter.  Pick the skillet up off of the burner and quickly add ¼ cup of batter. Immediately begin swirling the batter around the skillet so that it coats the bottom of the pan.  Continue swirling until the batter is just set.  Return skillet to the burner. Cook until the pancake is golden brown in spots on the bottom, about 30 seconds. Use a thin spatula to loosen the pancake, flip it over continue to cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.  Transfer to a plate. Cover with foil and transfer to oven to keep warm and repeat with remaining batter, wiping out skillet in between pancakes with paper towel as needed. </li>
                <li>Serve with lingonberry jam and butter (see note below) or other desired toppings and/or fillings. See notes below for more information about making ahead of time and storing in the refrigerator or freezer.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Cinnamon sugar coating: Combine sugar and cinnamon in a shallow bowl, set aside.</li>
                <li>Batter: Mix flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Add oil and water and mix until just combined - it should be a thick, gummy batter, like a wet sticky dough, not thin and watery.</li>
                <li>Piping bag: Transfer dough into a piping bag with a 8mm / 1/3" star tip nozzle. Set aside while oil heats.</li>
                <li>Heat oil: Heat 5cm / 2" oil over medium high in a small pot, wok or small but deep skillet (Note 3) to 170°C/340°F, or until it takes 20 seconds for a small cube of bread to turn golden.</li>
                <li>Pipe & snip: Pipe 15cm / 6" lengths of dough into the oil, snipping with scissors (snip close to oil surface to avoid splash). Do 3 to 4 per batch, makes 10 to 12 in total.</li>
                <li>Cook: Cook for 2-3 minutes or until golden and crisp, rolling occasionally.</li>
                <li>Drain: Remove onto paper towel lined plate to drain. Then roll in sugar. Serve hot with Chocolate Sauce!</li>
                <li>Chocolate Sauce: Place in a heatproof bowl and microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring in between, until smooth. Set aside for 5 minutes to cool and thicken slightly.</li>

            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan with butter or cooking spray.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, and melted butter. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared springform pan to form an even crust..</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese until smooth using an electric mixer. Add the granulated sugar and continue to beat until well combined. Mix in the sour cream, vanilla extract, and fresh lemon juice (if using) until the batter is smooth. Finally, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.</li>
                <li>Pour the cream cheese filling over the prepared crust in the springform pan. Smooth the top with a spatula. Bake in the preheated oven for about 55-65 minutes or until the center is set, and the top is lightly golden.</li>
                <li>Allow the cheesecake to cool in the oven with the door ajar for about an hour. Then, transfer it to the refrigerator and chill for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight.</li>
                <li>Once chilled, carefully remove the sides of the springform pan. Slice and serve your delicious cheesecake. You can optionally garnish with whipped cream, fresh berries, or a drizzle of fruit compote.</li>
            </ol>
